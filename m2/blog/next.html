    <h2><a href="./blog_individual.html">Collecting your shipping information</a></h2>
    <p>A few backers have been in touch to ask when they should send their address to us in order to receive The Manual. We’re not collecting any shipping details now. Instead, we’re waiting until we’re closer to the release date in order to make sure everything is as accurate and up-to-date as possible. We hope to be shipping Issue #1 around early/mid-July. We haven’t forgotten you and we’ll be sure to ask you for your address a few weeks in advance. </p>
