           <p>Jessica Hische is a letterer, designer, illustrator and general lover-of-the-internet currently residing in Brooklyn, NY. Jessica's Daily Drop Cap project, in which she illustrates a decorative initial cap every(ish) day, is what propelled her into public view, and her award-winning typography and illustration work continues to captivate designers and non-designers alike.</p> <p>At this talk, learn how specializing isn't really dead, how watching X-Files marathons can be as inspiring as a turn-of-the-century type specimen book and hear one person's opinion on the pros and cons of showing your humanity to the online universe.</p>

           <p>Let’s talk about tees, collaborations, mistakes, successes, working with artists and partners all over the world. About trying to keep up with, encourage and support the momentum of our tireless community. About turning off our computers and going outside. Let’s talk about going from a small group of founders to a bunch of artists and agency refugees. And about how to do all of this with your friends.</p>

           <p>Promising to be one of the most exciting events in this year's geek calendar, The Standardistas' Open Book Exam is a pub quiz, but with a difference. Unlike the typical pub quiz, where consulting your shiny internet-enabled mobile device would lead to instant disqualification; the Open Book Exam demands the use of iPhones, iPads, Androids - even Zunes - to avail of the internet's wealth of knowledge, required to answer many of the formidable questions.</p>

           <p>Played in teams of four, the exam will feature ten rounds of ten questions on topics ranging from the history of 68K Assembler to the experiments of Dr. Lawrence Angelo. As with any event worth its salt, there will be plenty of beer and plenty of prizes, including a shiny, new iPad for the Last Geek Standing.</p>

           <p>Entrepreneur John Hammond offers to fund Dr. Alan Grant’s palaeontology project for three years if he and his associate, Dr. Ellie Sattler will inspect his new island theme park. Unsure of what Jurassic Park is, Alan and Ellie reluctantly agree and are joined by Hammond’s two grandchildren, a corporate lawyer, and mathematician and chaos expert, Dr. Ian Malcolm.</p> <p>Hammond sends the group on a guided tour of the park, but along the way the electric tour cars break down, stranding them next to the T-Rex paddock while a tropical storm approaches ...</p>
